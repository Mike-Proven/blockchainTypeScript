# TypeScript Blockchain
Here I'm learning TypeScript and blockchain. I found a few youtube videos on it, but think I will keep working at it and maybe use some kind of clock API and base the currency on Minutes instead of difficulty, like a timer in a game that gives you points or something..

Just messing around with it and trying to figure a way to make it something functional that can run in multiple browsers and later get into the peer2peer code of it.

This will never be a currency/token/etc and no one will be able to buy it, but everyone will be able to mine it because I want it to run on a unified clock, some atomic clock from CERN or something, just like 1 coin a minute for as long as the app is running and connected to the p2p network. Something very flat and equal, like a 1 coin airdrop every minute to all wallet holders...

Then use the coin to buy game functions or something, maybe use it to reduce chat spam... again just for fun project and just for learning.
